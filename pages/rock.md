## ROCK

ROCK is an incremental game developed for iOS using the Unity game engine. The goal was to actually complete a game by not worrying about the graphics, and I have been working on it solo on and off for about a year. Despite its small expectations, it has proven an excellent lesson in Unity, UI design, game design, and separating data from UI. Hoping to release it to the App Store soon.
