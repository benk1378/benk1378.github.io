## ROCK

ROCK is an incremental mobile game developed for iOS using the Unity game engine. The goal was to actually complete a game by not worrying about the graphics, and I have been working on it on and off for about a year at the time I'm writing this.

More than anything, ROCK has been a huge learning experience for me. The biggest lesson I learned was to separate data and UI, as about 6 months into the project I realized that I had not considered a save system, and had to overhaul almost everything.
