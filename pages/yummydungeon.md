## Yummy Dungeon

Yummy Dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler developed using the Unity game engine. It's the first Unity project I've worked on with other people, a total of 4 devs contributing as of now. The game is centered around the idea of eating enemies to get stronger and create a unique build. I've posted a web build of the game to itch, with the password "morelikecrummydungeon"
