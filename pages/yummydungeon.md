## Yummy Dungeon

Yummy Dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler developed using the Unity game engine. The game is centered around the idea of eating enemies to get stronger and create a unique build. It's the first Unity project I've worked on with other people, with a total of 4 devs contributing as of now, and my contribution could be considered the gameplay programming. I helped create the procedural dungeon generation and implement most of the basic game mechanics.
