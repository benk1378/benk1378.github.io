I am a third year CS student at Cal Poly Humboldt, and in my free time I make video games.

Currently I have three main games that I'm working on:

*   [ROCK](./pages/rock.html)
*   [Chopper](./pages/chopper.html)
*   [Yummy Dungeon](./pages/yummydungeon.html)

These are all being developed using the Unity game engine, which I have the most experience in, but I have made projects using a myriad of tools. I've made prototypes in Godot, Phaser, Pygame, and Octave, from scratch in Java, JavaScript, and C++, and a bit of Minecraft modding.

Here are some of those projects:

*   [Untitled JavaScript Game](./untitledjavascriptgame.html)
*   [Untitled Godot Game](./pages/untitledgodotgame.html)
*   [Fish Ninja](./pages/fishninja.html)
*   [Planet Clicker](./pages/planetclicker.html)
*   [Ben's Mod](./pages/benmod.html)


Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```
