I am a third year CS student at Cal Poly Humboldt, and in my free time I make video games.

## School Projects

For school most of my experience revolves around using C++ and Linux, and the projects I've made focus on implementing algorithms or design patterns we learn in class.

*   [Diagram Editor (C++/Qt)](./pages/diagrameditor.html)
*   [Fish Ninja (GNU Octave)](./pages/fishninja.html)

## Personal Projects

For personal projects I've made a handful of small games, with a majority of my time spent using the Unity game engine. Here are the largest and most complete games I've made:

*   [ROCK (Unity)](./pages/rock.html)
*   [Yummy Dungeon (Unity)](./pages/yummydungeon.html)

As for the smaller games, I've made them using Godot, Phaser, Pygame, and Octave, and from scratch in Java, JavaScript, and C++. They end up being prototypes mainly just to get some familiarity with the language. Here's one as an example: [Solar Survivors (JavaScript)](/webprojects/solarsurvivors/)
