I am a third year CS student at Cal Poly Humboldt, and in my free time I make video games.

* * *

**Currently I have three main games that I'm working on:**

*   [ROCK](./pages/rock.html)
*   [Chopper](./pages/chopper.html)
*   [Yummy Dungeon](./pages/yummydungeon.html)

These are all being developed using the Unity game engine, which I have the most experience in, but I have made projects using a myriad of tools. I've made prototypes in Godot, Phaser, Pygame, and Octave, and from scratch in Java, JavaScript, and C++.

**Here are some of those projects:**

*   [Untitled Godot Game](./pages/untitledgodotgame.html)
*   [Fish Ninja](./pages/fishninja.html)
*   [Planet Clicker](./pages/planetclicker.html)
*   [Untitled JavaScript Game](./pages/untitledjavascriptgame.html)
*   [Solar Survivors](./pages/solarsurvivors.html)

*   [Digital Art Project](./pages/digitalartproject.html)
*   [Command Line Wordle](./pages/wordle.html)
